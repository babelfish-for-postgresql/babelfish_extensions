# 1. Lines starting with '#' will be treated as comments.
#
# 2. Keyword "all" is equivalent to running all tests.
#
# 3. To add a test, add test name on a new line.
#    Test names should be in the format <Test_Fixture.Test_Name>
#    E.g. MSSQL_Connection.SQLDriverConnect_SuccessfulConnectionTest
#
# 4. If you want the framework to not run certain tests, use: ignore#!#<Test_Fixture.Test_Name>
#    E.g. ignore#!#MSSQL_Connection.SQLDriverConnect_SuccessfulConnectionTest
