-- TODO CONVERT from int to string type is immutable and can be used to generate computed column
-- This is not straightforward to change atm because we currently use a wrapper function babelfish_conv_helper_to_varchar
-- to implement convert to varchar (in order to support the style parameter in convert),
-- and the function is defined as either VOLAITLE or IMMUTABLE (can't be IMMUTABLE conditionally)
-- However, in SQL Server convert to varchar is IMMUTABLE conditionally.
