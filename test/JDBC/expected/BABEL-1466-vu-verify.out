-- CONVERT is VOLATILE if one of these conditions exists:
-- 1. Source type is sql_variant.
-- 2. Target type is sql_variant and its source type is nondeterministic.
-- 3. Source or target type is datetime/datetime2/smalldatetime, the other source or target type is a character string/sql_variant/other datetime types.
-- VOLATILE functions can not be used to generate persisted computed columns, the following
-- tests are based on this rule.
-- CONVERT from int to smallint is immutable/deterministic and can be used to generate computed column

-- TODO CONVERT from int to string type is immutable and can be used to generate computed column
-- This is not straightforward to change atm because we currently use a wrapper function babelfish_conv_helper_to_varchar
-- to implement convert to varchar (in order to support the style parameter in convert),
-- and the function is defined as either VOLAITLE or IMMUTABLE (can't be IMMUTABLE conditionally)
-- However, in SQL Server convert to varchar is IMMUTABLE conditionally.
