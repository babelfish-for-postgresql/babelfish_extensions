-- For DMS, we've suggested the following PG functions related to identity
-- feature that can be called from TDS endpoint and they should get the exact
-- same behaviour as PG endpoint.  So, let's add some tests.
-- basic sequence operations for setval, nextval, currentval (tests are taken
-- src/test/regress/sql/sequence.sql PG regression test suite)
CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_test;

SELECT nextval('sequence_test');
