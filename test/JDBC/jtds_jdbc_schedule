# Schedule file for JDBC Test Framework running with jTDS driver instead of
# mssql-jdbc driver. When 'useJTDSInsteadOfMSSQLJDBC' config option is set to
# 'true' this file is used instead of 'jdbc_schedule' file.

# About the test that were copied with "jtds-prefix":
#
# jTDS has different behaviour from mssql-jdbc when error happens in a batch with multiple statements.
# If a batch contains multiple DML statements and one of them is causing an error (like constraint violation),
# then with mssql-jdbc stmt.execute() returns successfully, number of updated rows can be read from
# stmt.getUpdateCount() and the Exception is thrown on stmt.getMoreResults() only after all successful
# update counts are read.
#
# With jTDS, if none of the statements return a result set (no selects in batch, only DML), then the Exception
# is thrown on stmt.execute(). If this exception is caught and handled, then update counts from successul
# DML statements can be read with stmt.getUpdateCount().
# And if the successful batch statements return one or more result sets, then stmt.execute() succeeds,
# and update counts and result sets can be read successfully up to the errored one. And the Exception
# is thrown on rs.next() after the last successfull result set is exhausted.
#
# This jTDS behaviour is the same with both Babelfish and MSSQL.
