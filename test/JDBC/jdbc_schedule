# Schedule File for JDBC Test Framework for local run
# 1. Lines starting with '#' will be treated as comments
# 2. To run a postgres command:	cmd#!#postgresql#!#<enter postgres command>
# 3. To run a T-SQL command: cmd#!#sqlserver#!#<enter T-SQL command>
# 4. Keyword "all" is equivalent to running all test files in
#    input folder
# 5. To add a test, add test name (without extension Eg. BABEL-TEST) on a
#    new line
# 6. If you want the framework to not run certain files, use: ignore#!#<test name>

#TDS fault injection framework is meant for internal testing only. So, ignore tds_faultinjection tests in stable branch

# JDBC bulk insert API seems to call SET FMTONLY ON without calling SET FMTONLY OFF, causing some spurious test failures.
