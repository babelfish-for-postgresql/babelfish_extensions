/*
 * These tests validate the T-SQL RECOMPILE behaviour for stored procedures.
 * The approach is to demonstrate the recompilation by disabling index scans, 
 * and observing a different plan being generated only when RECOMPILE is used.

 * Note that when a cached plan is used, there is no good way to prove in these tests that 
 * it was indeed a cached plan, as it could just as well be a newly generated plan that 
 * happens to be the same as the previous plan. While developing this fix, the PG planner() 
 * function was instrumented to prove that cached plans are indeed used when plan_cache_mode={auto|force_generic_plan},
 * but that is outside the scope of what can be used in these automated tests.

 * This fix for forcing plans for statements in the procedure body to be recompiled only
 * applies to paramtrized statements. Non-parametrized stmts, like the 2nd select in tb_recomp_11, 
 * will not be recompiled since choose_custom_plan() will always return false for those.
 * The current fix can be extended to also force such stmts to be recompiled but that is 
 * left for later.
 
 * Not tested:
 * - recursive procedure calls, since Babelfish does not show plans when a conditional statement 
 *   is involved (manual testing has shown RECOMPILE works as expected, i.e. the recursive call is
 *   handled independently from the higher-level call)
 * - plans inside SQL functions or triggers (not shown by PG when called from a procedure)
