# Contents

This package includes 4 extensions:


- babelfishpg_tsql
    - Supports the tsql language.
- babelfishpg_tds
    - Supports the tds connection.
- babelfishpg_common
    - Supports the various datatypes in MSSQL.
- babelfishpg_money
    - supports the `money` type in MSSQL. This is a variation of the opensource fixeddecimal extension.

# How do I build the extensions?

The following build instructions comply with Ubuntu 20.04 and Amazon Linux 2 environment.

## Build the Postgres engine

1. First install dependent tools and libraries

    Install `postgresql-devel`, `libicu`, `libxml2`, `openssl` and `uuid-devel` packages in order to build Babelfish.

    You'll also need to install `gcc`, `gcc-c++`, `java` and `bison`.
    
    ```
    sudo apt-get install uuid-dev openjdk-8-jre \
                        libicu-dev libxml2-dev openssl libssl-dev python-dev \
                        libossp-uuid-dev libpq-dev pkg-config g++ build-essential bison 
    ```

    For RHEL-flavoured distributions, this is the command for dealing with the required dependencies:
    
    ```
    sudo yum install libicu-devel libxml2-devel \
                     openssl-devel uuid-devel postgresql-devel gcc gcc-c++ java
    ```

2. Now it's time to build the Postgres engine. In the Postgres engine directory, run these sequence of commands to build the PG engine modified for Babelfish (Github repo: https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/postgresql_modified_for_babelfish):
    ```
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/postgres/ --without-readline --without-zlib --enable-debug --enable-cassert CFLAGS="-ggdb" --with-libxml --with-uuid=ossp --with-icu
    make -j 4 2>error.txt
    make install
    make check
    ```

      Also build and install the extensions because uuid-ossp.so is a runtime dependency for babelfish:
      ```
      cd contrib && make && sudo make install
      ```

## Install & build dependencies


1. Get the latest version of cmake (version 3+ is required)

    To get and use the latest version of cmake:

    ```
    wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.20.6/cmake-3.20.6-linux-x86_64.sh
    sh cmake-3.20.6-linux-x86_64.sh
    ```


2. Install ANTLR

    The `babelfishpg_tsql` contrib has a plug-in parser generated by ANTLR, which depends on cmake and `antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.9.3`. Unfortunately, there aren't binaries for [C++ targets available](https://www.antlr.org/download.html). You'll also need have `uuid-devel` installed in order to install `antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.9.3`.

    First copy the jar file in `contrib/babelfishpg_tsql/antlr/thirdparty/antlr/` to another location:

    ```
    cd babelfish_extensions/contrib/babelfishpg_tsql/antlr/thirdparty/antlr/
    sudo cp antlr-4.9.3-complete.jar /usr/local/lib
    ```

    Compile antlr4:

    ```
    wget http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.9.3-source.zip
    unzip -d antlr4 antlr4-cpp-runtime-4.9.3-source.zip 
    cd antlr4
    mkdir build && cd build 
    cmake .. -DANTLR_JAR_LOCATION=/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.9.3-complete.jar -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DWITH_DEMO=True
    make
    sudo make install
    ```

    Copy libantlr4-runtime to postgres/lib
    ```
    cp /usr/local/lib/libantlr4-runtime.so.4.9.3 ~/postgres/lib/
    ```

    - If you come across the error
    ```
    -- Checking for module 'uuid'
    --   No package 'uuid' found
    CMake Error at /usr/local/share/cmake-3.21/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:554 (message):
        A required package was not found
    Call Stack (most recent call first):
        /usr/local/share/cmake-3.21/Modules/FindPkgConfig.cmake:776 (_pkg_check_modules_internal)
        CMakeLists.txt:44 (pkg_check_modules)
    ```
    Check that you have `uuid-devel` installed. If so, go to `antlr4/CMakeLists.txt` and comment out the line `pkg_check_modules(UUID REQUIRED uuid)` by adding a `#` to the beginning of the line.

    More information about installing ANTLR4 can be found [at this link](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~padro/CL/practica/install.html).



3. Set environment variables and paths

   - Set the `PG_CONFIG` environment variable to where you installed the DB engine `postgresql_modified_for_babelfish`. For example, I installed it under `~/postgres` (the default location), so I set `PG_CONFIG` as follows:

    ```
    export PG_CONFIG=~/postgres/bin/pg_config
    ```

    - Set `PG_SRC` to where the DB engine source package is as we need access to a few engine source
    files in order to build the Babelfish extensions. For example:
    ```
    export PG_SRC=~/workplace/postgresql_modified_for_babelfish
    ```

   - Set the cmake environment variable to where you installed cmake (as defined above in step 2). For example:

    ```
    export cmake=~/workplace/cmake-3.20.6-linux-x86_64/bin/cmake
    ```

    - Update the file `contrib/babelfishpg_tsql/antlr/CMakeLists.txt` with the correct antlr4-runtime path (if not there already). For example:

    ```
    SET (MYDIR /usr/local/include/antlr4-runtime/)
    ```
    

## Build the extensions
`make` and `make install` each extension within the extension project's `contrib` directory:

    cd contrib/babelfishpg_money
    make && make install
    cd ../babelfishpg_common
    make && make install
    cd ../babelfishpg_tds
    make && make install
    cd ../babelfishpg_tsql
    make && make install


# How to install the extensions and how to connect via SQLCMD?


1. Install the SQL server command line tools by following steps 1 - 3 under [Install the SQL Server command-line tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-red-hat?view=sql-server-ver15#tools). Use the RHEL7 URL in step 1.

    - For convenience, add `/opt/mssql-tools/bin/` and `~/postgres/bin` to your PATH environment variable. This enables you to run the tools without specifying the full path. For Z shell (the default shell for Cloud Desktop), add the following lines to your `~/.zshrc` file: 
    ```
    export PATH=/opt/mssql-tools/bin:$PATH
    export PATH=~/postgres/bin:$PATH
    ```


2. From where you installed `postgres` in the `./configure` step adjust the paths of these commands and run them to start the Postgres server:
    ```
    ~/postgres/bin/initdb -D ~/postgres/data/
    ~/postgres/bin/pg_ctl -D ~/postgres/data/ -l logfile start
    ```

3. 
- Modify `~/postgres/data/postgresql.conf` by uncommenting and adjusting the following 2 properties: 

    ```
    listen_addresses = '*'
    shared_preload_libraries = 'babelfishpg_tds'
    ```

- Modify `~/postgres/data/pg_hba.conf` to allow connections from allowed IP addresses, replacing `10.x.y.z` with your IP address. E.g.
    ```
      host    all             all     10.x.y.z/32            trust
    ```

- Now run this to apply the changes:
    ```
    ~/postgres/bin/pg_ctl -D ~/postgres/data/ -l logfile restart
    ```

4. Connect via psql using the command `~/postgres/bin/psql -U your_user_name`. Create the extension and set up essential parameters. Please be aware you need to choose either 'single-db' or 'multi-db' mode during this provisioning step and you CAN NOT change it later. Refer to our documentation page for more information on 'single-db' vs 'multi-db' mode.
    ```
    CREATE USER babelfish_user WITH CREATEDB CREATEROLE PASSWORD '12345678' INHERIT;
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS babelfish_db;
    CREATE DATABASE babelfish_db OWNER babelfish_user;
    \c babelfish_db
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "babelfishpg_tds" CASCADE;
    GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA sys to babelfish_user;
    ALTER SYSTEM SET babelfishpg_tsql.database_name = 'babelfish_db';
    ALTER SYSTEM SET babelfishpg_tds.set_db_session_property = true;
    ALTER DATABASE babelfish_db SET babelfishpg_tsql.migration_mode = 'single-db'|'multi-db';
    SELECT pg_reload_conf();
    CALL SYS.INITIALIZE_BABELFISH('babelfish_user');
    ```
      - If you run into errors connecting to psql such as `psql: error: could not connect to server: No such file or directory` try giving permissions by using this command instead:
          ```
          sudo ~/postgres/bin/psql -d postgres -U your_user_name
          ```

5. Try connecting to Babelfish via SQLCMD
      ```
      sqlcmd -S localhost -U babelfish_user -P 12345678
      ```
# How to run the JDBC regression tests?
1. Install Maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html
2. cd to test/JDBC
      ```
      cd test/JDBC
      ```
3. run cleanup.sh, init.sh and mvn test
      ```
      ./cleanup.sh
      ./init.sh
      mvn test
      ```
For detailed instructions on how to write, add, and run tests in JDBC test framework, refer [to the online instructions](../test/JDBC/README.md).


# How to build the babelfishpg_tsql extension with linked servers enabled

1. To work with linked servers, you must install the `tds_fdw` extension. More information about building and installing the extension can be found [at this link](https://github.com/tds-fdw/tds_fdw/blob/master/README.md).
2. Build the babelfishpg_tsql extension as follows:
    ```
    PG_CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/include -DENABLE_TDS_LIB' SHLIB_LINK='-lsybdb -L/usr/lib64' make
    PG_CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/include -DENABLE_TDS_LIB' SHLIB_LINK='-lsybdb -L/usr/lib64' make install
    ```
3. Create rest of the Babelfish extensions as usual, and initialize Babelfish.
4. Create the `tds_fdw` extension in the Babelfish database:
    ```
    babelfish_db=> CREATE EXTENSION tds_fdw;
    CREATE EXTENSION
    ```
